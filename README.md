# 3D Printer Model (SolidWorks)

This repository contains a complete **3D printer model** designed in **SolidWorks 2025**.  
The model includes all parts necessary for constructing the printer, including the **extruder mount, guide shafts, motors, ball screws**, and other essential components.

## 🛠️ Features
- Full 3D CAD model of a custom 3D printer
- Modular design for easy modification and enhancement
- Suitable for educational and prototyping purposes

## 🚀 How to Use
To visualize or work with the printer, **open `Assem1`** in SolidWorks.  
This assembly file contains all the parts and sub-assemblies in their correct positions.

## 🖥️ Extruder Path Simulation

In addition to the full 3D printer model, this repository includes a **Python script** that parses G-code files to simulate the movement of the extruder along a single layer.  
This feature can be used to:

- Visualize the printing path of the extruder
- Understand layer-by-layer printing mechanics
- Test and verify G-code before actual printing

### Requirements
- Python 3.13
- solidworks 2025
